# Mastery Challenge - Security 1
This repository contains my proof of completion for the Security 1 Mastery Challenge.

The basic flow of the program is as follows:
* Read a string from the user
* Encrypt the string using AES encryption
* Print the encrypted string
* Decrypt the string
* Print decrypted encrypted string (should be original input)

It also includes sample I/O to demonstrate what an execution of the program looks like.
